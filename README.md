## CSS Grid Exercise Admin Dashboard

My approach to the exercise [Dashboard with CSS Grid](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).  
The colors are from the [odin projects template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).  
The profile pictures are [AI-generated](https://chatgpt.com).  
The icons are from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).  
The font is from [fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto).
